## FAQ

**Can this handle long diffs?**

Not yet. It's something I'm hoping to work on. I don't know the exact limit yet.

**How much will this cost?**

With gpt-4-turbo it seems to be about 1 cent per use, though it could
be a little bit more. It's a lot less expensive with a gpt-3 based model, which also does a decent job.

**Is this real? Should I use this?**

Nope. It's just for a demo.
